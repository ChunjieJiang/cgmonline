<h1 id="population-genetics-of-grape-domestication">Population Genetics of Grape Domestication</h1>

<p>Population genetics of plant domestication had been widely studied for annuals, but less extensively for
perennials. The grapevine (Vitis vinifera spp. vinifera), the most economically important crop in the world,
has been used as a source of wine and food for thousands of years. However, grape domestication hasn’t
been studied using whole genome data. We sequenced population samples (Illumina for all and Pacbio
assemblies for few of them) of grape accessions with its putative wild progenitor (Vitis vinifera spp.
sylvestris), to address four ongoing mysteries about plant domestication. The first is the duration of
domestication; archaeological evidence suggests that domestication occurs over millennia, but genetic
evidence indicates that it can occur rapidly. We estimated that our wild and cultivated grape samples
diverged ∼22,000 years ago and that the cultivated lineage experienced a steady decline in population size
(Ne) thereafter. The long decline may reflect low-intensity management by humans before domestication.
The second mystery is the identification of genes that contribute to domestication phenotypes. In cultivated
grapes, we identified candidate-selected genes that function in sugar metabolism, flower development, and
stress responses. In contrast, candidate-selected genes in the wild sample were limited to abiotic and biotic
stress responses. A genomic region of high divergence corresponded to the sex determination region and
included a candidate male sterility factor and additional genes with sex-specific expression. The third
mystery concerns the cost of domestication. Annual crops accumulate putatively deleterious variants, in
part due to strong domestication bottlenecks. The domestication of perennial crops differs from that of
annuals in several ways, including the intensity of bottlenecks, and it is not yet clear if they accumulate
deleterious variants. We found that grape accessions contained 5.2% more deleterious variants than wild
individuals, and these were more often in a heterozygous state. Using forward simulations, we confirm that
clonal propagation leads to the accumulation of recessive deleterious mutations but without decreasing
fitness. The fourth is the importance of structural variation (SV), which is more and more recognized as an
important hidden layer of genomic diversity, but has been almost wholly ignored in genomic studies of plant
domestication. Most crop adaptation might have been driven by SVs, consequently, current studies of crop
adaptation may have missed most of the important genetic variants. We detected structural variations (SV)
including duplications, deletions, insertions, inversions, and translocations based on Illumina sequence
signals of read-depth, read-pair and split-read while using Pacbio assemblies as a verification. Population
genetics analyses suggested global SVs were deleterious and under strong purifying selection, and SVs at
genic regions led to gene structure changes, frame-shift, gene losses, and TE insertions/deletions
associated with important phenotypes. We found important SVs for grape domestication and SVs
underlying traits such as fruit color and the shift of sexual system from dioecy in wild grapes to
hermaphrodite in cultivars.</p>
